StrongDMM is an alternative yet robust map editor for BYOND.

It was built with the idea of creating a more flexible, fast, and extensible tool than the BYOND built-in map editor.
The editor has the same features as DM, but provides much more and improves the general map editing experience.

## Features

The editor offers a range of new features:

* TGM support with built-in map merger (no need to use external scripts and pre-commit hooks);
* Almost instant environment open;
* Custom layers filter;
* Built-in screenshot tool;
* Smooth zoom-in/zoom-out;
* Robust "Search";
* Improved shortcuts;
* Robust variables editor and variables preview;
* Optional sanitization of variables;
* Open with CLI.

...and a lot more...

## How to Use

StrongDMM is a single executable, which doesn't require any installation.
You can download it from any of the provided links and start it right away.

**Download Links:**

* [Windows](https://bit.ly/sdmm-windows)
* [Linux](https://bit.ly/sdmm-linux)
* [macOS](https://bit.ly/sdmm-macos)

[Release](https://github.com/SpaiR/StrongDMM/releases/latest) page contains all distributed files. It also has `sha256` hashes info for every executable for validation purposes.

### CLI Usage

StrongDMM do support CLI to quickly open maps. Provide `.dme` or `.dmm` files as program arguments:

###### With DME
```
strongdmm.exe path/to/environment.dme ./map1.dmm ../path/map2.dmm
```

###### Without DME
```
strongdmm.exe ./map1.dmm ../path/map2.dmm
```

When providing `.dmm` files without `.dme`, a proper environment file will be found automatically.

## Support

StrongDMM was developed without any monetization in mind. The main motivation is the enthusiasm for creating cool stuff.\
Your support can demonstrate your appreciation and will motivate further development of the project.

Additionally, if you have specific features in mind that you'd like implemented in the editor, we can focus on your needs.\

## FAQ

**Q.** My antivirus software detects something suspicious in the editor binaries. Is it ok?\
**A.** Yes, it's a false positive reaction to the way Golang, the development language, creates binaries. Read more: [Golang FAQ](https://go.dev/doc/faq#virus)

**Q.** How do I verify my executables?\
**A.** Verify them using `sha256` hashes, available on the [releases page](https://github.com/SpaiR/StrongDMM/releases/latest).

**Q.** But how can I trust executables on the release page?\
**A.** Executables are built with the [CI pipeline](https://github.com/SpaiR/StrongDMM/actions/workflows/ci.yml). You can verify the process yourself or build the executables manually from the source code.

**Q.** How to uninstall the editor?\
**A.** StrongDMM doesn't require installation, so no specific uninstallation process is needed. Simply delete the executable and, if desired, its directory on your OS to remove editor data.

**Q.** Where do I find editor data?\
**A.** For Windows: `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\StrongDMM`, for Linux/macOS: `~/.strongdmm`.

**Q.** How to move the map?\
**A.** Drag the map using the **middle mouse button**, or by holding the **space key**. Alternatively, you can use the **arrow keys**.

**Q.** How to zoom?\
**A.** Zoom using your mouse scroll wheel or the **+/- keys** on the keyboard.

**Q.** How to change the save format?\
**A.** Go to `File -> Preferences...` in the menu bar and select the desired format.

**Q.** The editor crashed. Where can I find logs?\
**A.** Access logs via the menu: `Help -> Open Logs Folder`.

## How to Build

Building the application involves two steps:

1. Build the **sdmmparser** library;
2. Build the editor.

**sdmmparser** is a Rust library based on the [SpacemanDMM](https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM) parser and is compiled to a `staticlib`.
It can be found at `internal/third_party/sdmmparser/src`.

### Prerequisites

* [Go](https://go.dev/): version **1.20** or higher.
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): version **1.79.0**.
* (Optional) [Task](https://taskfile.dev): for running build scripts.

#### For Windows

Ensure your Rust is configured to use the `stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` toolchain, as Go can't use MSVC for builds and requires GNU.
The easiest way to get the GNU compiler is to install MinGW through chocolatey, msys2, etc.

After installing MinGW, ensure that the path to its bin folder is added to the PATH environment variable.

#### For Linux

You may need to install dependencies for building GUI apps: `sudo apt install xorg-dev libgtk-3-dev`.

### Steps

#### Using Task

Task is a cross-platform Make alternative with scripts in `Taskfile.yml`.

With Task installed:

* `task build`: Builds sdmmparser and the editor (output in `dst` directory).
* `task run`: Runs the editor (compiles first if needed).

#### Manually

1. First, build the **sdmmparser** library.\
   Navigate to `third_party/sdmmparser/src` and run `cargo build --release`.\
   This step is needed only once unless **sdmmparser** is modified.
2. In the root directory:
    * `go build .`: Builds the editor (executable named `sdmm.exe`/`sdmm` in the root).
    * `go run .`: Runs the editor.
