# v2.6.0.alpha

### New open flow!

Since ancient times DreamMaker was teaching us that to open a map we need to open an environment first.<br>
But things have changed...<br>
Now there is no separate button to open either environment or a map. The "Open" button does all of that.<br>
If there is no environment loaded, StrongDMM will try to find and open one. The search is recursive, bottom-up through the directories.<br>

Referencing to the new open flow, now you can pass any .dme/.dmm files to StrongDMM as startup arguments.<br>
If you have passed only .dmm files, it will do the same as it is said above: automatically find and open .dme file for it.

### Improved access to recent environments and maps

The whole startup workspace was redesigned to provide more useful information.<br>
Now, by default, it contains recent environments and maps. But when you have opened environment it will show you all available maps for it.

### Available maps

StrongDMM v1 had a one called feature. And now it is fully back-ported to the v2.<br>
The new version also is more robust than the previous one. It supports hotkeys to select a range of maps to open.<br>
There were a bunch of requests to add an ability to open multiple maps at once, so now it is available.

### Search with replace/delete

Search functionality was missing a replace/delete feature.<br>
Back-ported functionality is able to replace not only with prefabs by passing their pass, but with any selected instance.

### Search filter

Also, search filter was totally revamped. Now it is more intuitive to use and easier to understand.<br>
Toggle a specific "Filter" button or use a hotkey when the search panel is focused: "F" key.

### Other Improvements and Fixes

* "Options" menu renamed to "View";
* Renamed "New Map" button to "Create Map" and moved to the "Edit" menu;
* Removed "Recent Environments" menu button;

* Added status indicators for the "Grab" tool: size and area bounds coordinates;
* Added information dialog when loading environment;
* Fixed invalid shortcuts handling with custom layout.

### Replace Tool!

"Replace" tool has been added. When enabled, it wll replace the clicked hovered instance with the selected prefab.
Tool has a quick shortcut to toggle: hold R key.

# v2.0.0.alpha

### Disclaimer!

This version is not a simple update, but a full rewrite from scratch. So, the "alpha" suffix means what it means.<br>
Some features may be absent, some bugs may exist. Feel free to post founded issues on GitHub.

### New GUI!

A new user interface became more "classic". Panels are now docked and by default there are three parts of the screen.

* Left: contains an environment tree;
* Right: here you can find everything about objects, their variables and so on;
* Central: a workspace area with all major windows (opened maps, preferences etc.).

One of the sweetest part of the new GUI is that all panels are movable! And their state persists between startups!<br>
Basically, you can drag any window to any side of the screen and dock it wherever you want.<br>
That is also applies for maps! You can open different map files and dock one to another.<br>
Thus, you'll see and edit both of them at the same time. Try it with "Mirror Canvas Camera" feature to see the real magic.

### New editing experience!

The biggest problem of the default DM editor is the way how variables are edited. To do that you need to open a modal dialog.<br>
Which is pretty annoying when you need to change a lot of stuff. The previous StrongDMM version repeated that approach.<br>
It had more features, yet the issue has not been solved.

Version 2 introduces a totally new approach: variables are always available! Without additional dialogs!<br>
You can select a prefab or a specific instance and modify their state right away.<br>
Because of that feature there is no need in a separate "preview" panel, which was a thing for a previous version.

### New shortcuts and tools!

There are separate tools to pick and to delete instances. They are a replacement for the old selection/deletion style.<br>
For example, instead of doing "Shift+LMB" (select hovered instance) you just hold "S" key. Same for instance deletion: hold "D" key.<br>
The new approach is simple and straightforward! Hover tools icons to see their tooltips.

### Other Improvements

* Multi-Z rendering is a thing. If one map file contains multiple z-levels, you can see on the upper level what happens on the lower.
* Auto-update is a part of the editor. This means, that sdmmlauncher is unneeded and deprecated.
* Types filter has been integrated in the environment tree. To enable it uses the "eye" button or "F" hotkey, when the tree is focused.
* The editor won't do keys re-arrangement on save.
* New search window with redesigned search results. You can use "Ctrl+F" to do a quick search.
* Quick Edit window for nudges and dirs. In the bottom-right corner of the canvas you can find a panel, to modify those vars faster.

And there more to come...
